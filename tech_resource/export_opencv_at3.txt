opencv@3 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have opencv@3 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/opencv@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find opencv@3 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/opencv@3/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/opencv@3/include"
